	abstract = {Advances in machine learning, especially the introduction of transformer architectures and vision transformers, have led to the development of highly capable computer vision foundation models. The segment anything model (known colloquially as SAM and more recently SAM 2), is a highly capable foundation model for segmentation of natural images and has been further applied to medical and scientific image segmentation tasks. SAM relies on prompts -- points or regions of interest in an image -- to generate associated segmentations. In this manuscript we propose the use of a geometrically motivated prompt generator to produce prompt points that are colocated with particular features of interest. Focused prompting enables the automatic generation of sensitive and specific segmentations in a scientific image analysis task using SAM with relatively few point prompts. The image analysis task examined is the segmentation of plant roots in rhizotron or minirhizotron images, which has historically been a difficult task to automate. Hand annotation of rhizotron images is laborious and often subjective; SAM, initialized with GeomPrompt local ridge prompts has the potential to dramatically improve rhizotron image processing. The authors have concurrently released an open source software suite called geomprompt https://pypi.org/project/geomprompt/ that can produce point prompts in a format that enables direct integration with the segment-anything package.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Current state‐of‐the art procedures for studying modeled submesoscale oceanographic features have made a strong assumption of independence between features identified at different times. Therefore, all submesoscale eddies identified in a time series were studied in aggregate. Statistics from these methods are illuminating but oversample identified features and cannot determine the lifetime evolution of the transient submesoscale processes. To this end, the authors apply the Topological Feature Tracking (TFT) algorithm to the problem of identifying and tracking submesoscale eddies over time. TFT identifies critical points on a set of time‐ordered scalar fields and associates those points between consecutive timesteps. The procedure yields tracklets which represent spatio‐temporal displacement of eddies. In this way we study the time‐dependent behavior of submesoscale eddies, which are generated by a 1‐km resolution submesoscale‐permitting model. We summarize the submesoscale eddy data set produced by TFT, which yields unique, time‐varying statistics.

            Plain Language Summary
            Current state‐of‐the art procedures for studying small‐scale features in the ocean do not take the effects of time into account. Instead, features like small vortices are studied as a single population across many points in time. This method has provided oceanographers with many valuable insights. New insights can be added by identifying vortices and then tracking them over time to study their behavior through an algorithm designed to identify and track features on a grid.

                  Topological Feature Tracking is introduced as a way to identify features in scalar fields and associate those features through time
                
                
                  We identify and track submesoscale eddies over 1‐year of ocean surface velocity data computed via the Navy Coastal Ocean Model
                
                
                  Eddy statistics provide insight on lifetime, speed, and distance traversed for understanding eddy motions and scale interactions},

CDER applies to a training set of labeled pointclouds embedded in a common Euclidean space. If typical pointclouds corresponding to distinct labels tend to differ at any scale in any sub-region, CDER can identify these differences in (typically) linear time, creating a set of distributional coordinates which act as a feature extraction mechanism for supervised learning. We describe theoretical properties and implementation details of CDER, and illustrate its benefits on several synthetic examples.},
